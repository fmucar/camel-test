    • Expose a Restful Service
    • HTTP verb as POST and Media Type can be JSON or XML
    • Define/Create a front end and backend schema’s (JSON or XML Schema’s) – A simple schema should be sufficient.

    • Transform a Message (Front end JSON or XML format to a backend JSON or XML format)
    • Validate a transformed message (using a backend JSON or XML Schema)
